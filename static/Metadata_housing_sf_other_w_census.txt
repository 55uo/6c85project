Description: This dataset was created from MAPC's Zoning Atlas. It consists of spatial data and associated tabular data for the single-family and other types of housing in zoning districts of the 101 municipalities in the MAPC region. This dataset only keeps housing zones in Metro Boston and combines zones according to whether it is only single-family zoning by municipalities. Besides, this data aggregates the race and income data extracted from census data. There are two rows for some municipalities in this dataset to indicate only single-family zoning and other housing zoning.

Attributes: 
	fid:
		type: Integer
		description: 
	muni_id:
		type: Double
		description: Municipal ID number
	muni:
		type: String
		description: Municipal name the area belongs to.
	is_housing
		type: Integer
		description: If the area is housing zoning. "1" indicates the area is housing zoning, "0" indicates not. We only keep the housing zoning area in this dataset, hence the value in this column is 1 for all rows. This also is reflected in the fragmented municipality boundaries. 
	only_single_family:
		type: Integer
		description: If the area is only for single family housing. "1" indicates the area is only single family. "0" indicates it is for other housing zonings, for instance, multifamily. We combine the zones that are only_single_family into one shape by the municipality and ones that are not only_single_family into another shape. So there are two rows for some municipalities in this dataset.
	%_single_family:
		type: Double
		description: The percentage of how much of residential land in that municipality is zoned exclusively for single-family homes. The values are equal to: (the land area of a single family for that municipality)/(land area of the housing zoning for that municipality). Unit: %.
	is_MBTA_community:
		type: Integer
		description: If the town shows up in the MBTA communities list. "1" indicates positive and "0" means it does not.

Attributes below are aggregated by zoning area from census data, 2014-18 income(Blocks Groups). As the Blocks Groups are more general than zoning, when certain zoning areas are too small, their income values may be lost because they cannot be aggregated. The total households from income data may be different from the households from population data as they come from different years.
